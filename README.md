### Code for team 3773P (BowBots Phosphorus) 2023 VRC: Spin Up
This is the code used for our robot during the 2023 competition

PS: We are a team of all highschool freshmen so please don't criticize our code too much but, if there is something that you see coud be fixed do not hesitate to submit a PR or leave a comment.

Liscense: If you are using or modifying this for your own robot there is no need to give credit unless you think it neccesary, all code posted here was written by me with the exception of the original PID code which was written by Evan Ingoldsby.
